\begin{itemize}
    \item Unix mechanism for starting a new process: \texttt{fork()}
    \item creates a \myemph{copy} of an entire program!
    \item (usually, the copy then calls \texttt{execve} --- replaces itself with another program)
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item how isn't this really slow?
\end{itemize}
