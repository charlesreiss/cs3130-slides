\begin{frame}{fairer spinlocks}
\begin{itemize}
\item so far --- everything on spinlocks
    \begin{itemize}
    \item mutexes, condition variables --- built with spinlocks
    \end{itemize}
\item spinlocks are pretty `unfair'
    \begin{itemize}
    \item where fair = get lock if waiting longest
    \end{itemize}
\item last CPU that held spinlock more likely to get it again
    \begin{itemize}
    \item already has the lock in its cache\ldots
    \end{itemize}
\item but there are many other ways to spinlocks\ldots
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,label=ticketLock]{ticket spinlocks}
\begin{lstlisting}
unsigned int serving_number;
unsigned int next_number;

Lock() {
    // "take a number"
    unsigned int my_number = atomic_read_and_increment(&next_number);
    // wait until "now serving" that number
    while (atomic_read(&serving_number) != my_number) {
        /* do nothing */
    }
    // MISSING: code to prevent reordering reads/writes
}

Unlock() {
    // serve next number
    serving_number += 1;
    // MISSING: code to prevent reordering reads/writes
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{ticket spinlocks and cache contention}
\begin{itemize}
\item still have contention to write next\_number
\item \ldots but no retrying writes!
    \begin{itemize}
    \item should limit `ping-ponging'?
    \end{itemize}
\item threads loop performing a read repeatedly while waiting
    \begin{itemize}
    \item value will be broadcasted to all processors
    \item `free' if using a bus
    \item not-so-free if another way of connecting CPUs
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{beyond ticket spinlocks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux kernel used to use ticket spinlocks
\item now uses variant of MCS spinlocks --- locks have linked-list queue!
    \begin{itemize}
    \item careful use of atomic operations to modify queue
    \end{itemize}
\item still try 
\item goal: even less contention
    \begin{itemize}
    \item unlocking value doesn't require broadcasting to all CPUs
    \item each processor waits on its own cache block
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
