\begin{itemize}
    \item What do you need to wait for?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item critical section to be finished
            \item queue to be non-empty
            \item array to have space for new items
        \end{itemize}
    \item what can you count that will be 0 when you need to wait?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \# of threads that can start critical section now
            \item \# of threads that can join another thread without waiting
            \item \# of items in queue
            \item \# of empty spaces in array
        \end{itemize}
    \item use up/down operations to maintain count
\end{itemize}
