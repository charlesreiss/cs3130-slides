\begin{frame}{why spurious wakeups?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item makes implementing condition variables simpler
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> can be hard to avoid loop in more complicated scenarios
      % FIXME: timeline?
    \item<2-> e.g. signal() saying okay to remove item from queue \\ what if another thread sneaks in and does it first?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item maybe signal() could be redesigned to prevent this somehow?
        \item \ldots but that's harder to implement
        \end{itemize}
