\begin{frame}{atomic operation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{atomic operation} = operation that runs to completion or not at all
\item we will use these to let threads work together
\vspace{.5cm}
\item most machines: loading/storing {\small (aligned)} words is atomic
    \begin{itemize}
    \item so can't get $3$ from $x \leftarrow 1$ and $x \leftarrow 2$ running in parallel
    \item aligned $\approx$ address of word is multiple of word size (typically done by compilers)
    \end{itemize}
\item but some instructions are not atomic; examples:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item x86: integer \texttt{add} constant to memory location
    \item many CPUs: loading/storing values that cross cache blocks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item e.g. if cache blocks \texttt{0x40} bytes, load/store 4 byte from addr. \texttt{0x3E} is not atomic
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
