\begin{frame}{load/store reordering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item load/stores atomic, but run \textit{out of order}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item recall?: out-of-order processors
    \item processor optimization: sometimes execute instructions in non-program order
        \begin{itemize}
        \item hide delays from slow caches, variable computation rates, etc.
        \item documneted limits on when this is/is not allowed
        \end{itemize}
    \item track side-effects \textit{within a thread} to make as if in-order
        \begin{itemize}
        \item but common choice: don't worry as much between cores/threads
        \item design decision: if programmer cares, they worry about it
        \end{itemize}
    \item want to avoid this \textit{special instructions ensure strict ordering}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{why load/store reordering?}
\begin{itemize}
\item prior example: load of x executing before store of y
\item why do this? otherwise delay the load
    \begin{itemize}
    \item if x and y unrelated --- no benefit to waiting
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
