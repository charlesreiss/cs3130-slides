    \begin{itemize}
    \item can you use a vector from multiple threads?
    \item \ldots question: how is it implemented?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> dynamically allocated array
        \item<2-> reallocated on size changes
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<3-> can access from multiple threads \ldots \myemph{as long as not append/erase/etc.}?
    \item<3-> assuming it's implemented like we expect\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
        \item but can we really depend on that?
        \item e.g. could shrink internal array after a while with no expansion save memory?
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile,label=cppStdRules]{C++ standard rules for containers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item multiple threads can \myemph{read anything at the same time}
    \item can only read element \myemph{if no other thread is modifying it}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item can safely \myemph{add/remove elements if no other threads} are accessing container
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (sometimes can safely add/remove in extra cases)
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item exception: vectors of bools --- can't safely read and write at same time
        \begin{itemize}
        \item might be implemented by putting multiple bools in one int
        \end{itemize}
