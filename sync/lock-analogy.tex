    \begin{itemize}
    \item agreement: only change account balances while wearing this hat
    \item normally hat kept on table
    \item put on hat when editing balance
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item hopefully, only one person (= thread) can wear hat a time
    \item need to wait for them to remove hat to put it on
        \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> ``lock (or acquire) the lock'' = get and put on hat
    \item<2-> ``unlock (or release) the lock'' = put hat back on table
