    \item agreement: only change account balances while wearing this hat
    \item normally hat kept on table
    \item put on hat when editing balance

    \item hopefully, only one person (= thread) can wear hat a time
    \item need to wait for them to remove hat to put it on

    \item<2-> ``acquire (or lock) the lock'' = get and put on hat
    \item<2-> ``release (or unlock) the lock'' = put hat back on table
