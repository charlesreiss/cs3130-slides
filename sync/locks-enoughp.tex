\begin{frame}{are locks enough?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item do we need more than locks?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{example 1: pipes?}
\begin{itemize}
\item suppose we want to implement a pipe with threads
\item \texttt{read} sometimes needs to wait for a \texttt{write}
\item don't want busy-wait
\begin{itemize}
\item (and trick of having writer unlock() so reader can finish a lock() is illegal)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{more synchronization primitives}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item need other ways to wait for threads to finish
    \item we'll introduce several synchronization ideas beyond locks:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item barriers --- (today)
        \item condition variables / monitors
        \item counting semaphores
        \item reader/writer locks
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
