\begin{frame}{implementing consistency: simple}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item simplest idea: only one run transaction at a time
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{implementing consistency: locking}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item everytime something read/written: acquire associated lock
    \item on end transaction: release lock
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item if deadlock: \myemph<2>{undo everything}, go back to BeginTransaction(), retry
        \begin{itemize}
        \item how to undo?
        \item one idea: keep list of writes instead of writing
        \item apply writes only at EndTransaction()
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{implementing consistency: optimistic}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item on read: copy value read
    \item on write: record value to be written, but don't write yet
    \item on end transaction: 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item acquire locks on everything
        \item make sure values read haven't been changed since read
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item if they have changed, just retry transaction
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{implementing durability}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what if there's a crash
    \item we might have written some things but not others
    \item most common approach: write-ahead logging
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item write list of intended operations + marker that list is complete
    \item then do operations
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item after crash: check for intended operations
    \item redo them \textit{only if list is complete}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
