    \begin{itemize}
    \item what if there's a crash
    \item we might have written some things but not others
    \item most common approach: write-ahead logging
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item write list of intended operations + marker that list is complete
    \item then do operations
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item after crash: check for intended operations
    \item redo them \textit{only if list is complete}
    \end{itemize}
