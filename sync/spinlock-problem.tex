    \begin{itemize}
    \item \myemph<4>{lock abstraction is not powerful enough}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item lock/unlock operations don't handle ``wait for event''
        \item common thing we want to do with threads
        \item solution: other synchronization abstractions
        \end{itemize}
    \item \myemph<3>{spinlocks waste CPU time more than needed}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item want to run another thread instead of infinite loop
        \item solution: lock implementation integrated with scheduler
        \end{itemize}
    \item \myemph<2>{spinlocks can send a lot of messages on the shared bus}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item more efficient atomic operations to implement locks
        \end{itemize}
