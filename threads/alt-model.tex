\begin{itemize}
\item we'll talk about \myemph{kernel threads}
\item OS scheduler deals \textbf{directly} with threads
\vspace{1cm}
\item alternate idea: library code handles threads
\item kernel doesn't know about threads w/in process
\item \textit{hierarchy} of schedulers: one for processes, one within each process
\item not currently common model --- awkward with multicore
\end{itemize}
