\begin{frame}[fragile]{pthread\_join, pthread\_exit}
\begin{itemize}
\item R = \texttt{pthread\_join}(X, \verb|&|P): wait for thread X, copies return value into P
    \begin{itemize}
    \item like \texttt{waitpid}, but for a thread
    \item thread return value is pointer to anything
    \item R = 0 if successful, error code otherwise
    \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{pthread\_exit}: exit current thread, returning a value
    \begin{itemize}
    \item like \texttt{exit} or returning from main, but for a single thread
    \item same effect as returning from function passed to pthread\_create
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
