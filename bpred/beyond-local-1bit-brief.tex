\begin{frame}{beyond local 1-bit predictor}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item can predict using more historical info
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item whether taken last several times
            \begin{itemize}
            \item example: taken 3 out of 4 last times $\rightarrow$ predict taken
            \end{itemize}
        \item pattern of how taken recently
            \begin{itemize}
            \item example: if last few are T, N, T, N, T, N; next is probably T
            \item makes two branches hashing to same entry not so bad
            \end{itemize}
        \item outcomes of last N conditional jumps (``global history'')
            \begin{itemize}
            \item take into account conditional jumps in surrounding code
            \item example: loops with if statements will have regular patterns
            \end{itemize}
