\begin{frame}{indirect branch prediction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for instructions like: \texttt{jmp *\%rax} or \texttt{jmp *(\%rax, \%rcx, 8)}
        \item simple idea: record what happened last time, predict the same
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item Intel Haswell extension:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item lookup in based on hash of \textit{last several jump addresses}
            \item allows different predictions based on context of \texttt{jmp *\%rax}
            \item really useful for polymorphism
            \end{itemize}
