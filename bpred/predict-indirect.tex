\begin{frame}{indirect branch prediction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for instructions like: \texttt{jmp *\%rax} or \texttt{jmp *(\%rax, \%rcx, 8)}
        \item simple idea: record what happened last time, predict the same
        \item example: Intel's Haswell strategy:
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item maintain hash of last several jump/call/etc. instruction addresses
            \begin{itemize}
            \item address of jump + how we got there
            \end{itemize}
        \item lookup hash in table of targets
        \item use result as prediction, update if prediction wrong
    \end{itemize}
