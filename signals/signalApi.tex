\begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt sigaction} --- register handler for signal
    \item {\tt kill} --- send signal to process
        \begin{itemize}
        \item uses \myemph{process ID} (integer, retrieve from \texttt{getpid()})
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\tt pause} --- put process to sleep until signal received
    \item {\tt sigprocmask} --- temporarily block/unblock some signals from being received
        \begin{itemize}
        \item signal will still be \textit{pending}, received if unblocked
        \end{itemize}
    \item \ldots{} and much more

    \item \texttt{kill 1234} --- sends SIGTERM to pid 1234
        \begin{itemize}
        \item in C: \texttt{kill(1234, SIGTERM)}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{kill -USR1 1234} --- sends SIGUSR1 to pid 1234
        \begin{itemize}
        \item in C: \texttt{kill(1234, SIGUSR1)}
