\begin{itemize}
\item don't do it (unless you're very careful)
\vspace{.5cm}
\item \texttt{cin}/\texttt{scanf} read some extra characters into a buffer?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item you call \texttt{read} --- they disappear!
    \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{cout}/\texttt{printf} has output waiting in a buffer?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item you call \texttt{write} --- out-of-order output!
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item (if you need to: some stdio calls specify that they clear out buffers)
\end{itemize}
