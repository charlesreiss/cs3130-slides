\begin{frame}{partial reads}
\begin{itemize}
    \item on regular file: read reads what you request
    \item but otherwise: usually gives you what's known to be available
        \begin{itemize}
            \item after waiting for something to be available
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> reading from network --- what's been received
    \item<2-> reading from keyboard --- what's been typed
