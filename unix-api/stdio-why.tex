\begin{frame}{stdio and iostreams}
\begin{itemize}
\item what about \texttt{cout}, \texttt{printf}, etc.?
\item \ldots implemented in terms of \texttt{read}, \texttt{write}, \texttt{open}, \texttt{close}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item adds buffering in the process --- faster
    \begin{itemize}
    \item read/write typically system calls
    \item running system call for approx. each character is slow!
    \item \textit{in addition} to buffering that occurs in the kernel
    \end{itemize}
\item more convenient
    \begin{itemize}
    \item formatted I/O, partial reads/writes handled by library, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\item more portable
    \begin{itemize}
    \item stdio.h and iostreams defined by the C and C++ standards
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
