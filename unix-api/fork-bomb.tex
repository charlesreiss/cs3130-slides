    \item what's going to happen?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item lots of CPU being used
        \item lots of memory being allocated
        \item control-C might only terminate one of the processes
        \end{itemize}
    \item<2-> \myemph{probably very bad and hard to recover from}

\begin{frame}{some recommendations re: timing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in timing assignment, you'll need to run \texttt{fork()} multiple times to measure it
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item I recommend:
    \item always waitpid \myemph{successfully} before fork()ing a second time
    \item test fork()ing exactly once before doing a loop
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
