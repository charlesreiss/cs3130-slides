\begin{frame}{system call terminology}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some inconsistency:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item system call = event of entering kernel mode on request?
    \item system call = whole process from beginning to end?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item same issue as with `function call'
	\begin{itemize}
	\item is it just starting the function, or the whole time the function runs?
	\end{itemize}
