\begin{frame}{program crashing?}
\begin{itemize}
\item what happens on processor when program crashes?
\vspace{.5cm}
\item other program informed of crash to display message
\item use processor to run some other program
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<2-> how does hardware do this?
\item<2-> would be complicated to tell about other programs, etc.
\item<2-> instead: hardware runs designated OS routine
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{exceptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item recall: system calls --- software asks OS for help
\vspace{.5cm}
\item also cases where hardware asks OS for help
\item different triggers than system calls
\item but same mechanism as system calls:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item switch to kernel mode (if not already)
    \item call OS-designated function
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
