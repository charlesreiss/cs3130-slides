\begin{frame}{controlled entry to kernel mode (1)}
\begin{itemize}
\item special instruction: ``make system call''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item similar idea as \texttt{call} instruction --- jump to function elsewhere
    \item (and allow that function to return later)
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item runs OS code in kernel mode at location specified earlier 
\item OS sets up at boot
\item location can't be changed without privilieged instrution
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{controlled entry to kernel mode (2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item OS needs to make specified location:
\vspace{.5cm}
\item figure out what operation the program wants
    \begin{itemize}
    \item calling convention, similar to function arguments + return value
    \end{itemize}
\item be ``safe'' --- not allow the program to do `bad' things
    \begin{itemize}
    \item example: checks whether current program is allowed to read file before reading it
    \item requires exceptional care --- program can try weird things
    \end{itemize}
