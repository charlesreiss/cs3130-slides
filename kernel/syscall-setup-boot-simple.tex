\begin{itemize}
\item OS specifies where to start executing code in kernel mode
    \begin{itemize}
    \item typically set at boot
    \item requires privileged instructions to change
    \end{itemize}
\item OS makes sure the code it says to start is ``safe''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (hopefully)
    \item example: checks whether current program is allowed to read file before reading it
    \end{itemize}
