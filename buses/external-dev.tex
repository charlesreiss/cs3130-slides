\begin{frame}{buses interfacing to buses}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item many translators from system buses to other buses
    \item fast but very processor-specific system bus
    \item more generic/standardized buses for other devices
        \begin{itemize}
        \item USB
        \item PCIe
        \item SATA
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\againframe<2>{stdBusDiag}

\begin{frame}{memory-mapped I/O}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item devices expose ``memory locations'' to read/write
    \item OS: use read/write instructions to manipulate device
    \item device controller: handle reads/writes for those addreses on the bus
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item device controller implements same protocol has memory
    \item but makes reads/writes do very different things
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{memory-mapped I/O example}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item example: keyboard controller
    \item \myemph<2>{read from magic memory location} --- get last keypress/release
    \item reading location clears buffer for next keypress/release
    \item \myemph<3>{get interrupt} whenever new keypress/release you haven't read
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{device as magic memory (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item example: display controller
    \item write to pixels to magic memory location --- displayed on screen
    \item other memory locations control format/screen size
        \vspace{.5cm}
    \item example: network interface
    \item write to buffers 
    \item write ``send now'' signal to magic memory location --- send data
    \item read from ``status'' location, buffers to receive
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{talking to devices?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item looks same as talking to memory
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item ``memory-mapped I/O''
    \item magic memory locations
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item operating system reads/writes to special addresses
    \item device controller decides what accessing those memory locations does
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
