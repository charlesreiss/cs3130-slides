\begin{frame}{possible security properties? (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what we'll talk about: 
    \item confidentiality --- information shared only with those who should have it
    \item authenticity --- message genuinely comes from right principal (and not manipulated)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{possible security properties? (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item important ones we won't talk about\ldots:
    \item repudiation --- if A sends message to B, B can't prove to C it came from A
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (takes extra effort to get along with authenticity)
        \end{itemize}
    \item forward-secrecy --- if A compromised now, E can't use that to decode past conversations with B
    \item anonymity --- A can talk to B without B knowing who it is
    \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
