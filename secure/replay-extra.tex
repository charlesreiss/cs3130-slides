    \item another solution to replay attacks:
    \item B$\rightarrow$A: [next number \myemph{\#91523}] [signature from B] \\
    A$\rightarrow$B: \myemph{\#91523} Did you order lunch? [next number \myemph{\#90382}] [signature from A] \\
    B$\rightarrow$A: \myemph{\#90382} Yes. [next number \myemph{\#14578}] [signature from B] \\
    \ldots \\
    A$\rightarrow$B: \myemph{\#6824} There's a guy at the door, says he's here to repair the AC. Should I let him in? [next number \myemph{\#36129}][signature from A]

    \item (assuming A actually checks the numbers)

\begin{frame}{confusion about who's sending?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in addition to nonces, either
        \begin{itemize}
        \item write down more who is sending + other context so message can't be reused and/or
        \item use unique set of keys for each principal you're talking to
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item with symmetric encryption, also ``reflection attacks''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item A sends message to B, attacker sends A's message back to A as if it's from B
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
