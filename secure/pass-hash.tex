\begin{frame}{password hashing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item cryptographic hash functions are good at requiring guesses to `reverse'
        \item idea: store cryptographic hash of password instead of password
            \begin{itemize}
            \item attacker who gets hash doesn't get password
            \item can still check entered password is correct
            \end{itemize}
            \vspace{.5cm}
        \item<2-> problem: with fast hash function, can try lots of guesses fast
        \item<3-> solution: special slow/resource-intensive cryptographic hash functions
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Argon2i
            \item scrypt
            \item PBKDF2
            \end{itemize}
