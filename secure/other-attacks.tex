    \begin{itemize}
    \item from \url{https://mitls.org/pages/attacks/SMACK}
    \item protocol:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item step 1: verify server identity
        \item step 2: receive messages from server
        \end{itemize}
    \item attack:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item if server sends ``here's your next message'', \\
            instead of ``here's my identity'' \\
        \item then broken client ignores verifying server's identity
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item one example from \url{https://nebuchadnezzar-megolm.github.io/static/paper.pdf}
    \item system for confidential multi-user chat
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item protocol + goals:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item each device (my phone, my desktop) has public key
        \item to talk to me, you verify one of my public keys
        \item to add devices, my client can forward my other devices' public keys
        \end{itemize}
    \item bug:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item when receiving new keys, clients did not check who they were forwarded from correctly
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
