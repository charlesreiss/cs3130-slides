\begin{frame}{asymmetric encryption}
\begin{itemize}
\item we'll have two functions:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item encrypt: $E(\text{public key}, \text{message}) = \text{ciphertext}$
    \item decrypt: $D(\text{private key}, \text{ciphertext}) = \text{message}$
    \end{itemize}
\item (public key, private key) = ``key pair''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item generated together
    \item public key can be shared with everyone
    \item knowing $E$, $D$, the public key, and ciphertext shouldn't make it too easy to find message \\
        (or the private key)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{public keys}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item public key used to encrypt
    \item can share this with everyone!
    \item conceptually: just post where everyone can see it\ldots \\
        and attacker can't replace/change it
        \begin{itemize}
        \item enough versus passive attackers w/o sharing info advance
        \item not enough versus active attackers
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item private key used to decrypt
    \item kept secret
    \item don't even share with people sending us messages
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
