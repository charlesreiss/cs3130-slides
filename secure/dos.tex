    \item if you just want to inconvenience\ldots
    \item attacker just sends lots of stuff to my server
    \item my server becomes overloaded?
    \item my network becomes overloaded?

    \item but: doesn't this require a lot of work for attacker?
    \item exercise: why is this often not a big obstacle

    \begin{itemize}
    \item work for attacker > work for defender
    \item how much computation per message?

        \item complex search query?
        \item something that needs tons of memory?
        \item something that needs to read tons from disk?
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{denial of service: reflection/amplification}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item instead of sending messages directly\ldots
        attacker can send messages ``from'' you to third-party
    \item third-party sends back replies that overwhelm network
    \item example: short DNS query with lots of things in response

    \item ``amplification'' =
        \begin{itemize}
        \item third-party inadvertantly turns small attack into big one
