    \begin{itemize}
    \item problem: shared secrets usually aren't practical
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item \myemph<2>{need secure communication before I can do secure communication?}
    \item need to redo it every time I talk to new person?
    \item scaling problem: millions of websites $\times$ billions of browsers = how many keys?
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{bootstrapping keys?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item will still need to have some sort of secure communication to setup!
    \item but will minimize:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> \myemph<3>{can be broadcast communication}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item don't need full new sets of keys for each web browser
        \end{itemize}
    \item<2-> only with smaller number of trusted authorities
        \begin{itemize}
        \item don't need to have keys for every website in advance
