\begin{frame}{network security summary (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item communicating securely with math
        \begin{itemize}
        \item secret value (shared key, public key) that attacker can't have
        \item symmetric: shared keys used for (de)encryption + auth/verify; fast
        \item asymmetric: public key used by any for encrypt + verify; slower
        \item asymmetric: private key used by holder for decrypt + sign; slower
        \end{itemize}
    \item protocol attacks --- repurposing encrypt/signed/etc. messages
    \item certificates --- verifiable forwarded public keys 
    \item key agreement --- for generated shared-secret ``in public''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item publish key shares from private data
        \item combine private data with key share for shared secret
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{network security summary (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item TLS: combine all cryptography stuff to make ``secure channel''
    \item denial-of-service --- attacker just disrupts/overloads (not subtle)
    \item firewalls
    \end{itemize}
