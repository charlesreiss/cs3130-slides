\begin{frame}{tools, but...}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item have building blocks, but less than straightforward to use
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item lots of issues from using building blocks poorly
    \item start of art solution: formal proof sytems
        \begin{itemize}
        \item mathematical proof that attacker doing X implies encryption/MAC/etc. broken
        \item ideally a somewhat machine-checkable proof
        \end{itemize}
    \item (we aren't going to be that formal\ldots)
    \end{itemize}
