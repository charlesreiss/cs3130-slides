    \item if A is talking to B are communicating, \\
        what stops M from pretending to be B?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item assumption: B knows some \myemph{secret information} that M does not
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> start: assume A and B have a \textit{shared secret} they both know
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (and M, E do not)
        \end{itemize}
    \item<2-> (later: easier to setup assumptions)

\begin{frame}{bad ways to use shared secret}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A $\rightarrow$ B: What's the password?
    \item B $\rightarrow$ A: It's `\texttt{Abc\$xyM\$e}'.
    \item A $\rightarrow$ B: That's right! Here's my confidential information.
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> well, this doesn't really help: 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item against E, who can read the password AND confidential info
        \item against M, who can also pretend to be A for B
        \end{itemize}
