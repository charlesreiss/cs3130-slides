    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose A, B have shared keys $K_1,K_2$
        \begin{itemize}
        \item assume attackers do not have keys
        \end{itemize}
    \item E/D = encrypt/decrypt function
    \item A asks B to pay Sue \$100 by sending message with these parts:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``2023-11-03: pay \$100''
        \item $E(K_1, \text{``2023-11-03 Sue''})$
        \item $MAC(K_2, \text{``2023-11-03: pay \$100''})$
        \end{itemize}
    \item 1. can eavesdropper learn: (a) who is being paid, (b) how much?
    \item 2. can machine-in-middle change: (a) who is being paid, (b) how much?
    \end{itemize}
