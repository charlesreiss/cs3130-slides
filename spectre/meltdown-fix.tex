\begin{frame}{Meltdown fix}
\begin{itemize}
\item HW: permissions check done with/before physical address lookup
    \begin{itemize}
    \item was already done by AMD, ARM apparently?
    \item now done by Intel
    \end{itemize}
\item SW: separate page tables for kernel and user space
    \begin{itemize}
    \item don't have sensitive kernel memory pointed to by page table \\
        when user-mode code running
    \item unfortunate performance problem
    \item exceptions start with code that switches page tables
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
