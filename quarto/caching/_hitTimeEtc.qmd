### reasoning about cache performance  {.smaller}


* <em>hit time</em>: time to lookup and find value in cache 

   * L1 cache --- typically 1 cycle?

* <em>miss rate</em>: portion of hits (value in cache)
* <em>miss penalty</em>: extra time to get value if there's a miss 

   * time to access next level cache or memory

* <em>miss time</em>: hit time + miss penalty


### average memory access time 


* $\\text{AMAT} = \\text{hit time} + \\text{miss penalty} \\times{} \\text{miss rate}$
* effective speed of memory
