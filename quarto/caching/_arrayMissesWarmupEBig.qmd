### C and cache misses (5)

```c
int array[1024]; /* assume aligned */ int even = 0, odd = 0;
even += array[0];
even += array[2];
even += array[512];
even += array[514];
odd += array[1];
odd += array[3];
odd += array[511];
odd += array[513];

```
[ Assume everything but `array` is kept in registers (and the compiler does not do anything funny).
<br> observation: `array[0]` and `array[512]` exactly 2KB apart]{.my-small} 

* How many data cache misses on a 2KB direct mapped cache with 16B blocks?
