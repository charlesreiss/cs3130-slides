### AMAT exercise (1)  {.smaller}


* 90% cache hit rate
* hit time is 2 cycles
* 30 cycle miss penalty
* what is the average memory access time?
* [5 cycles]{.fragment}
<hr class="vspace" />
* suppose we could increase hit rate by increasing its size, but it would increase the hit time to 3 cycles
* how much do we have to increase the hit rate for this to not increase AMAT?
* [to miss rate of 2/30 $\rightarrow$ to approx 93% hit rate]{.fragment}
