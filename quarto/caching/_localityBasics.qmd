### memory hierarchy assumptions  {.smaller}


* _temporal locality_ <br> ‘‘if a value is accessed now, it will be accessed again soon’’ 

   * caches should keep _recently accessed values_
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* _spatial locality_ <br> ‘‘if a value is accessed now, adjacent values will be accessed soon’’ 

   * caches should <em>store adjacent values at the same time</em>
   
<hr class="vspace" />
* natural properties of programs --- think about loops


### locality examples  {.smaller}
 
```c
double computeMean(int length, double *values) {
    double total = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        total += values[i];
    }
    return total / length;
}
```
 

* temporal locality: machine code of the loop
* spatial locality: machine code of most consecutive instructions
* temporal locality: <code>total</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>length</code> accessed repeatedly
* spatial locality: <code>values[i+1]</code> accessed after <code>values[i]</code>
