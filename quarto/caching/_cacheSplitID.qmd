### hierarchy and instruction/data caches  {.smaller}


* typically separate data and instruction caches for L1 
<hr class="vspace" />
* (almost) never going to read instructions as data or vice-versa
* avoids instructions evicting data and vice-versa
* can optimize instruction cache for different access pattern
* easier to build fast caches: that handles less accesses at a time
