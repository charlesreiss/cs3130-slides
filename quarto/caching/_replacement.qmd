### example replacement policies  {.smaller}


* least recently used 
   * take advantage of <em>temporal locality</em>
   * at least $\left\lceil{}\log_2(E!)\right\rceil$ bits per set for $E$-way cache 
      * (need to store order of all blocks)
* approximations of least recently used 
   * implementing least recently used is expensive
   * really just need ‘‘avoid recently used’’ --- much faster/simpler
   * good approximations: $E$ to $2E$ bits
* first-in, first-out 
   * counter per set --- where to replace next
* (pseudo-)random 
   * no extra information!
   * actually works pretty well in practice
