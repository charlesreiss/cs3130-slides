### recall: data/instruction memory  {.smaller}


* model in CPU: one cycle per access 
<hr class="vspace" />
* but earlier --- had to talk to memory on different chip
* can't do that in one cycle 
<hr class="vspace" />
* solution: keep copies of part of memory (‘‘cache’’) 

   * copy can be accessed quickly
   * hope: almost always use copy?
