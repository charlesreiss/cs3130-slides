### cache miss types  {.smaller}


* common to categorize misses: 

   * roughly ‘‘cause’’ of miss assuming cache block size fixed
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* <i>compulsory</i> (or <i>cold</i>) --- <em>first time</em> accessing something 

   * adding more sets or blocks/set wouldn't change

* <i>conflict</i> --- sets aren't big/flexible enough 

   * a fully-associtive (1-set) cache of the same size would have done better

* <i>capacity</i> --- cache was not big enough
* <i>coherence</i> --- from sync'ing cache with other caches 

   * only issue with multiple cores
