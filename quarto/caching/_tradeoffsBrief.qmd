### cache tradeoffs briefly  {.smaller}


* deciding cache size, associativity, etc.?
* lots of tradeoffs: 

   * more cache hits v. slower cache hits?
   * faster cache hits v. fewer cache hits?
   * (N+1)th-level cache v. larger Nth level cache?
   * …

* details depend on programs run 

   * how often is same block used again?
   * how often is same index bits used?
   * how much {temporal,spatial} locality to take advantage of?

* simulation to assess impact of designs
