### prefetching  {.smaller}


* seems like we can't really improve cold misses…
* have to have a miss to bring value into the cache? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* solution: don't require miss: ‘prefetch' the value before it’s accessed
* remaining problem: how do we know what to fetch?


### common access patterns  {.smaller}


* suppose recently accessed 16B cache blocks are at: 

   * 0x48010, 0x48020, 0x48030, 0x48040

* guess what's accessed next 
<hr class="vspace" />
* common pattern with <em>instruction fetches</em> and <em>array accesses</em>


### prefetching idea  {.smaller}


* look for sequential accesses
* bring in guess at next-to-be-accessed value
* if right: no cache miss (even if never accessed before)
* if wrong: possibly evicted something else --- could cause more misses 

   * fortunately, sequential access guesses almost always right
