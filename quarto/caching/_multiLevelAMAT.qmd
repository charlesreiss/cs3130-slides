### exercise: AMAT and multi-level caches  {.smaller}

* suppose we have L1 cache with 
   * 3 cycle hit time, 90% hit rate
* and an L2 cache with 
   * 10 cycle hit time, 80% hit rate (for accesses that make this far)
   * (assume all accesses come via this L1)
* and main memory has a 100 cycle access time
* assume when there's an cache miss, the next level access starts after the hit time 
   * e.g. an access that misses in L1 and hits in L2 will take 10+3 cycles
* what is the average memory access time for the L1 cache? 
   * [$3 + 0.1\cdot(10 + 0.2\cdot 100) = 6$ cycles]{.fragment fragment-index=1}
   * [L1 miss penalty is $10 + 0.2\cdot100 = 30$ cycles]{.fragment fragment-index=1}
