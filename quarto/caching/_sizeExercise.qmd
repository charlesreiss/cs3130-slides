### cache size exercise {.smaller}

- A system uses a direct-mapped cache with 32 byte blocks.
- Two memory accesses are made:

  - Read `0x08249`
  - Read `0x0c658`

- What is the fewest number of cache sets this cache could have to prevent the second read from evicting the first?
- What is the size of this cache?


<!--
0x08249: 1000 0010 0100 1001
               iii iiio oooo
0x0c658: 1100 0110 0101 1000

index: 6 bits
2^6 = 64 sets


32 bytes * 64 sets = 2^(5+6) = 2^11 = 2048 bytes
