### a threaded server?  {.smaller}


<pre><code>Deposit(accountNumber, amount) {
    account = <em>GetAccount(accountId)</em>;
    account-&gt;balance += amount;
    <em>SaveAccountUpdates(account);</em>
}
</code></pre>
 

* maybe GetAccount/SaveAccountUpdates can be slow? 

   * read/write disk sometimes? contact another server sometimes?

* maybe lots of requests to process? 

   * maybe real logic has more checks than Deposit()
   * …

* all reasons to handle multiple requests at once
* $\rightarrow$ many threads all running the server loop
