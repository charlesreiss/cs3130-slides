### mfence  {.smaller}


* x86 instruction <code>mfence</code>
* make sure all loads/stores in progress finish
* … and make sure no loads/stores were started early 
<hr class="vspace" />
* fairly expensive  

   * Intel ‘Skylake’: order 33 cycles + time waiting for pending stores/loads
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* aside: this instruction did not exist in the original x86 <br> so xv6 uses something older that's equivalent
