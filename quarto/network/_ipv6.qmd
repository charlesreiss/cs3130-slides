### IPv6 addresses  {.smaller}


* IPv6 like IPv4, but with 128-bit numbers
* written in hex, 16-bit parts, seperated by colons (<code>:</code>)
* strings of 0s represented by double-colons (<code>::</code>)
* typically given to users in blocks of $2^{80}$ or $2^{64}$ addresses 

   * no need for address translation?
