### a table on my desktop  {.smaller}

my desktop: <br> 
```
$ arp -an
? (128.143.67.140) at 3c:e1:a1:18:bd:5f [ether] on enp0s31f6
? (128.143.67.236) at <incomplete> on enp0s31f6
? (128.143.67.11) at 30:e1:71:5f:39:10 [ether] on enp0s31f6
? (128.143.67.92) at <incomplete> on enp0s31f6
? (128.143.67.5) at d4:be:d9:b0:99:d1 [ether] on enp0s31f6

```
 … 

* network address to link-layer address + interface
* only tracks things directly connected to my local network 

   * non-local traffic sent to local router



### how is that table made? 


* ask all machines on local network (same switch)
* ‘‘Who has 128.148.67.140’’
* the correct one replies
