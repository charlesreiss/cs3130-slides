### Hoare versus Mesa monitors  {.smaller}


* Hoare-style monitors 

   * signal ‘hands off’ lock to awoken thread

* Mesa-style monitors 

   * any eligible thread gets lock next
   * (maybe some other idea of priority?)
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* every current threading library I know of does Mesa-style
