### why spurious wakeups?  {.smaller}


* makes implementing condition variables simpler 
<hr class="vspace" />
* can be hard to avoid loop in more complicated scenarios
* e.g. signal() saying okay to remove item from queue <br> what if another thread sneaks in and does it first? 

   * maybe signal() could be redesigned to prevent this somehow?
   * … but that's harder to implement
