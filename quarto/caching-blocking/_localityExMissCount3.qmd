### exercise: miss estimating (3)  {.smaller}


```
for (int kk = 0; kk < 1000; kk += 10)
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 1000; jj += 10)
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i += 1)
            for (int j = jj; j < jj+10; j += 1)
                for (int k = kk; k < kk + 10; k += 1)
                    A[k*N+j] += B[i*N+j];

```
 

* assuming: 4 elements per block
* assuming: cache not close to big enough to hold 1K elements, but big enough to hold 500 or so 
<hr class="vspace" />
* estimate: <i>approximately</i> how many misses for A, B? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* hint 1: part of A, B loaded in two inner-most loops only needs to be loaded once
* hint 2: part of A can be reused between iterations of <code>i</code> loop
