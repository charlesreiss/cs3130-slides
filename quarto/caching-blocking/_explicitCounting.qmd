### keeping values in cache  {.smaller}


* can't <i>explicitly</i> ensure values are kept in cache
* … but reusing values <i>effectively</i> does this

<hr class="vspace" />
* cache optimization ideas: choose what's in the cache 

   * for thinking about it: load values explicitly
   * for implementing it: access only values we want loaded
