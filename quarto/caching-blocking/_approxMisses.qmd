### approximate miss analysis  {.smaller}


* very tedious to precisely count cache misses 

   * even more tedious when we take advanced cache optimizations into account
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* instead, approximations:
* [good or bad temporal/spatial locality]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only} 

   * good temporal locality: value stays in cache
   * good spatial locality: use all parts of cache block

* with nested loops: what does inner loop use? 

   * intuition: values used in inner loop loaded into cache once
   * (that is, once each time the inner loop is run)
   * … if they can all fit in the cache
