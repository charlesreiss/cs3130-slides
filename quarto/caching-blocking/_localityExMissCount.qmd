### exercise: miss estimating (1)  {.smaller}

<!-- \lstset{language=C,style=small} -->
 
```
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j)
        A[i] += B[j] * C[i * N + j]

```
 

* Assume: 4 array elements per block, N very large, nothing in cache at beginning.<br>
* Example: $N/4$ estimated misses for A accesses: 

   * A[i] should always be hit on all but first iteration of inner-most loop.
   * first iter: A[i] should be hit about 3/4s of the time (same block as A[i-1] that often)

* Exericse: estimate # of misses for B, C
