### cache blocking: summary  {.smaller}


* reorder calculation to reduce cache misses:
* make <em>explicit choice</em> about what is in cache
* perform calculations in <em>cache-sized blocks</em>
* get more spatial and temporal locality
* temporal locality --- <em>reuse values</em> in many calculations 

   * before they are replaced in the cache

* spatial locality --- use <em>adjacent values</em> in calculations 

   * before cache block is replaced
