### implementing mutexes with semaphores


```c
struct Mutex {
    Semaphore s; /* with inital value 1 */
    /* value = 1 --> mutex if free */
    /* value = 0 --> mutex is busy */
}

MutexLock(Mutex *m) {
    m->s.down();
}

MutexUnlock(Mutex *m) {
    m->s.up();
}

```


### implementing join with semaphores


```c
struct Thread {
    ...
    Semaphore finish_semaphore; /* with initial value 0 */
    /* value = 0: either thread not finished OR already joined */
    /* value = 1: thread finished AND not joined */
};
thread_join(Thread *t) {
    t->finish_semaphore.down();
}

/* assume called when thread finishes */
thread_exit(Thread *t) {
    t->finish_semaphore.up();
    /* tricky part: deallocating struct Thread safely? */
}

```
