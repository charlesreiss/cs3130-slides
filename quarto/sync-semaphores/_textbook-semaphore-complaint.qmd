### Anderson-Dahlin and semaphores  {.smaller}


* Anderson/Dahlin complains about semaphores 

   * ‘‘Our view is that programming with locks and condition variables is superior to programming with semaphores.’’

* argument 1: clearer to have <em>separate constructs</em> for 

   * waiting for condition to be come true, and
   * allowing only one thread to manipulate a thing at a time

* arugment 2: tricky to verify thread calls up exactly once for every down 

   * alternatives allow one to be sloppier (in a sense)
