### exception implementation 


* detect condition (program error or external event)
* save current value of PC somewhere
* jump to <em>exception handler</em> (part of OS) 

   * jump done without program instruction to do so



### exception implementation: notes 


* I describe a <em>simplified</em> version
* real x86/x86-64 is a bit more complicated 

   * (mostly for historical reasons)
