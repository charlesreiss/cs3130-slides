### program crashing?  {.smaller}


* what happens on processor when program crashes? 

* other program informed of crash to display message
* use processor to run some other program 

* how does hardware do this?
* would be complicated to tell about other programs, etc.
* instead: hardware runs designated OS routine


### exceptions  {.smaller}


* recall: system calls --- software asks OS for help 

* also cases where hardware asks OS for help
* different triggers than system calls
* but [same mechanism as system calls]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only}: 

   * switch to kernel mode (if not already)
   * call OS-designated function
