### program crashing?


* what happens on processor when program crashes? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* other program informed of crash to display message
* use processor to run some other program 
<hr class="vspace" />
* how does hardware do this?
* would be complicated to tell about other programs, etc.
* instead: hardware runs designated OS routine


### exceptions

* recall: system calls --- software asks OS for help
<hr class="vspace" />
* also cases where hardware asks OS for help
* different triggers than system calls
* but [same mechanism as system calls]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only}: 
   * switch to kernel mode (if not already)
   * call OS-designated function (configured at boot)
