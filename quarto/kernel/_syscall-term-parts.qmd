### system call terminology 

* some inconsistency: 
<hr class="vspace" />
* system call = event of entering kernel mode on request?
* system call = whole process from beginning to end? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* same issue as with ‘function call’  

   * is it just starting the function, or the whole time the function runs?
