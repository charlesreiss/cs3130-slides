### threads  {.smaller}


* thread = illusion of own processor 
<hr class="vspace" />
* own register values
* own program counter value 
<hr class="vspace" />
* actual implementation: <br> many threads sharing one processor 

   * problem: where are register/program counter values <br> when thread not active on processor?
