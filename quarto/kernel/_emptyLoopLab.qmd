### emptyloop lab (1)


```c
long last_time = GetTime();
while (NotDone()) {
    long current_time = GetTime();
    RecordDelta(current_time - last_time);
    last_time = current_time;
}

```
 

* naive computer model:<br/>RecordDelta called with roughly same number each time


### emptyloop lab (2)


```c
long last_time = GetTime();
while (NotDone()) {
    long current_time = GetTime();
    /* maybe OS handles I/O here? */
    /* maybe OS runs ssh for a bit here? */
    /* ... */
    RecordDelta(current_time - last_time);
    last_time = current_time;
}

```
 

* will see spikes in recorded times from exceptions
* can infer what system is doing


### emptyloop lab (3)


* upcoming lab: we'll supply program that times in loop
* also will look at Linux counters for asynchronous exceptions 
<hr class="vspace" />
* should be able to observe when OS/other programs run
* (and about how long)
