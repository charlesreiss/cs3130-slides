### why return from exception?  {.smaller}

<!-- \lstset{language=myasm} -->
 

* reasons related to protection (later)
* not just ret --- can't modify process's stack 

   * would break the <em>illusion of dedicated CPU/memory</em>
   * program could use stack in weird way 
```
movq $100, -8(%rsp)
...
movq -8(%rsp), %rax
```
 

      * (even though this wouldn't be following calling conventions)

   * need to restart program <em>undetectably</em>!
