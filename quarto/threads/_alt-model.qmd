### aside: alternate threading models  {.smaller}


* we'll talk about <em>kernel threads</em>
* OS scheduler deals <em>directly</em> with threads 
<hr class="vspace" />
* alternate idea: library code handles threads
* kernel doesn't know about threads w/in process
* <i>hierarchy</i> of schedulers: one for processes, one within each process
* not currently common model --- awkward with multicore
