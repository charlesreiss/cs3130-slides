### pthread_join, pthread_exit  {.smaller}


* R = <code>pthread_join</code>(X, `&`P): wait for thread X, copies return value into P 

   * like <code>waitpid</code>, but for a thread
   * thread return value is pointer to anything
   * R = 0 if successful, error code otherwise

* <code>pthread_exit</code>: exit current thread, returning a value 

   * like <code>exit</code> or returning from main, but for a single thread
   * same effect as returning from function passed to pthread_create
