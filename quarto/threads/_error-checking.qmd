### a note on error checking  {.smaller}



* from pthread_create manpage:
 
![](/threads/pthread-create-errors){fig-alt="ERRORS: EAGAIN: Insufficient resources to create another thread, or a system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered. The latter case may occur in two ways: the RLIMIT_NPROC soft resource limit was reached; or the kernel's system-wide limit on the number of threads,  /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max, was reached.  EINVAL: Invalid settings in attr. EPERM: No permission to set the scheduling policy and parameters specified in attr."}
 
* special constants for <i>return value</i> 
<hr class="vspace" />
* same pattern for many other pthreads functions 
   * pthread_join, pthread_mutex_… (later), …
* will often omit error checking in slides for brevity


### error checking pthread_create 


```c
int error = pthread_create(...);
if (error != 0) {
    /* print some error message */
}

```
