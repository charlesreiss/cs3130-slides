### why threads?  {.smaller}


* concurrency: different things happening at once 

   * one thread per user of web server?
   * one thread per page in web browser?
   * one thread to play audio, one to read keyboard, …?
   * …

* parallelism: do same thing with more resources 

   * multiple processors to speed-up simulation (life assignment)
