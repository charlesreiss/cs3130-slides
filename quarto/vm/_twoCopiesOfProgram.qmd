### two copies of program 


* would like to only have one copy of program code
* could setup both page tables to point to same code, but...
<hr class="vspace" />
* what if <code>mst3k</code>'s vim tries to modify its code?
   *  (presumably because of bug)
* would break <code>xyz4w</code>'s vim
* violates process abstraction:
   * "illusion of own memory"
