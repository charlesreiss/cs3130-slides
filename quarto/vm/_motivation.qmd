### this layout is what we want {.smaller}

- programs know their addresses when compiled
  - compiler can generate smaller, more efficient code
- programs have (essentially) unlimited memory
  - or at least it appears that way
- programs are not machine-specific (within same ISA)
  - i.e., don't need to know how much memory is installed





### but, this has a number of issues! {.smaller}

![](/vm/texfig/recallAddr.figure-1.svg){.absolute top=10 left=700 width="350" height="300"}

- every program uses the same addresses
  - could only run one program at a time
- our machines don't actually have unlimited memory



### _virtualization_ allows us to address this {.smaller}

- virtualization: allow many users to access the same computing hardware resources as if they were the only user


- examples:
  - virtual machine: multiple OSes running on same hardware
  - virtual memory: multiple processes using same physical memory
