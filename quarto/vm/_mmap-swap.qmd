### swapping almost mmap  {.smaller}


* access mapped file for first time, read from disk 

   * (like swapping when memory was swapped out)

* write ‘‘mapped’’ memory, write to disk eventually 

   * (like writeback policy in swapping)
   * use ‘‘dirty’’ bit
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* extra detail: other processes should see changes 

   * all accesses to file use <em>same physical memory</em>
