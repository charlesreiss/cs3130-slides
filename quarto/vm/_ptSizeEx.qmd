### exercise: page counting 


* suppose 32-bit virtual (program) addresses
* and each page is 4096 bytes ($2^12$ bytes) 
<hr class="vspace" />
* how many virtual pages?
* \\iftoggle{heldback$2^32 / 2^12 = 2^20$}


### exercise: page table size  {.smaller}


* suppose 32-bit virtual (program) addresses
* suppose 30-bit physical (hardware) addresses
* each page is 4096 bytes ($2^12$ bytes)
* page table entries have physical page #, valid bit 
<hr class="vspace" />
* how big is the page table (if laid out like ones we've seen)?
* \\iftoggle{heldback$2^20$ entries $\\times{} (18 + 1)$ bits per entry}  

   * issue: where can we store that?



### exercise: address splitting 


* and each page is 4096 bytes ($2^12$ bytes)
* split the address <code>0x12345678</code> into page number and page offset:
* \\iftoggle{heldbackpage #: \\tt0x12345{}; offset: <code>0x678</code>}
