### on virtual address sizes

* virtual address size = size of pointer? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* often, but --- sometimes part of pointer not used
* example: typical x86-64 only use 48 bits 

   * rest of bits have fixed value

* virtual address size is amount used for mapping


### address space sizes  {.smaller}


* amount of stuff that can be addressed = address space size 

   * based on number of unique addresses

* e.g. 32-bit virtual address = $2^{32}$ byte virtual address space
* e.g. 20-bit physical addresss = $2^{20}$ byte physical address space 
<hr class="vspace" />
* what if my machine has 3GB of memory (not power of two)? 

   * not all addresses in physical address space are useful
   * most common situation (since CPUs support having a lot of memory)
