### exercise: 64-bit system  {.smaller}



* my desktop: 39-bit physical addresses; 48-bit virtual addresses
* 4096 byte pages
* exercise: how many page table entries? (assuming page table like shown before) 
* exercise: how large are physical page numbers? [$39 - 12 = 27$ bits]{.fragment fragment-index=1}
* page table entries are <em>8 bytes</em> (room for expansion, metadata) 
   * trick: power of two size makes table lookup faster
* [would take up $2^{39}$ bytes?? (512GB??)]{.fragment fragment-index=2}
