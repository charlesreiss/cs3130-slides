### cache coherency exercise  {.smaller}


* modified/shared/invalid; all initially invalid; 32B blocks, 8B read/writes 

   * CPU 1: read 0x1000
   * CPU 2: read 0x1000
   * CPU 1: write 0x1000
   * CPU 1: read 0x2000
   * CPU 2: read 0x1000
   * CPU 2: write 0x2008
   * CPU 3: read 0x1008

* Q1: final state of 0x1000 in caches?  

   * Modified/Shared/Invalid for CPU 1/2/3
   * CPU 1:   CPU 2:   CPU 3:  

* Q2: final state of 0x2000 in caches?  

   * Modified/Shared/Invalid for CPU 1/2/3
   * CPU 1:   CPU 2:   CPU 3:
