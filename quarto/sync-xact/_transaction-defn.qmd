### transactions 



* transaction: set of operations that occurs atomically
* idea: something higher-level handles locking, etc.:
 
```
BeginTransaction();
int FromOldBalance = GetBalance(FromAccount);
int ToOldBalance = GetBalance(ToAccount);
SetBalance(FromAccount, FromOldBalance - 100);
SetBalance(ToAccount, ToOldBalance + 100);
EndTransaction();

```
 

* idea: library/database/etc. makes ‘‘transaction’’ happens all at once


### consistency / durability  {.smaller}


* ‘‘happens all at once’’ = could mean: 
<hr class="vspace" />
* locking to make sure no other operations interfere (consistency)
* making sure on crash, no partial transaction seen (durability) 
<hr class="vspace" />
* []{.my-small} (some systems provide both, some provide only one)
* we'll just talk about implementing consistency
