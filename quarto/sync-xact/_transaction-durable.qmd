### implementing durability  {.smaller}


* what if there's a crash
* we might have written some things but not others
* most common approach: write-ahead logging 
<hr class="vspace" />
* write list of intended operations + marker that list is complete
* then do operations 
<hr class="vspace" />
* after crash: check for intended operations
* redo them <i>only if list is complete</i>
