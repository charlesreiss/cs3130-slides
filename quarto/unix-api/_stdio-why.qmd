### stdio and iostreams  {.smaller}


* what about <code>cout</code>, <code>printf</code>, etc.?
* … implemented in terms of <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>close</code> 
<hr class="vspace" />
* adds buffering in the process --- faster 

   * read/write typically system calls
   * running system call for approx. each character is slow!
   * <i>in addition</i> to buffering that occurs in the kernel

* more convenient 

   * formatted I/O, partial reads/writes handled by library, etc.

* more portable 

   * stdio.h and iostreams defined by the C and C++ standards
