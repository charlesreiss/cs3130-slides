### parent and child processes  {.smaller}



* every process (but process id 1) has a <i>parent process</i> (<code>getppid()</code>)
* this is the process that can wait for it
* creates tree of processes (Linux <code>pstree</code> command):
 
![](/unix-api/process-tree){}
 
![](/unix-api/process-tree2){}


### parent and child questions\ldots  {.smaller}


* what if parent process exits before child? 

   * child's parent process becomes process id 1 (typically called <i>init</i>)

* what if parent process never <code>waitpid()</code>s [ (or equivalent)]{.my-small} for child? 

   * child process stays around as a ‘‘zombie’’
   * can't reuse pid in case parent wants to use <code>waitpid()</code>

* what if non-parent tries to <code>waitpid()</code> for child? 

   * waitpid fails
