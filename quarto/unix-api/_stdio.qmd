### mixing stdio/iostream and raw read/write  {.smaller}


* don't do it (unless you're very careful) 
<hr class="vspace" />
* <code>cin</code>/<code>scanf</code> read some extra characters into a buffer? 

   * you call <code>read</code> --- they disappear!

* <code>cout</code>/<code>printf</code> has output waiting in a buffer? 

   * you call <code>write</code> --- out-of-order output!
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* (if you need to: some stdio calls specify that they clear out buffers)
