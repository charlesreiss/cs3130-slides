### POSIX: standardized Unix  {.smaller}


* Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)  

   * ‘‘standard for Unix’’

* current version online: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/
* (almost) followed by most current Unix-like OSes
* … but OSes add extra features
* … and POSIX doesn't specify everything


### what POSIX defines  {.smaller}


* POSIX specifies the <em>library and shell interface</em> 

   * source code compatibility

* doesn't care what is/is not a system call…
* doesn't specify binary formats…
* idea: write applications for POSIX, recompile and run on all implementations 

   * this was a very important goal in the 80s/90s
   * at the time, no dominant Unix-like OS (Linux was very immature)
