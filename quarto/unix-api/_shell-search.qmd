### searching for programs  {.smaller}


* POSIX convention: PATH <i>environment variable</i> 

   * example: <code>/home/cr4bd/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</code>
   * list of directories to check in order

* environment variables = key/value pairs stored with process 

   * by default, left unchanged on execve, fork, etc.

* one way to implement:  [pseudocode] 
```
for (directory in path) {
    execv(directory + "/" + program_name, argv);
}

```
