### warning re: forking in loops  {.smaller}

<!-- \lstset{language=C,style=smaller} -->
 
```c
while (true) {
    fork();
}

```
 

* what's going to happen? 

   * lots of CPU being used
   * lots of memory being allocated
   * control-C might only terminate one of the processes

* _probably very bad and hard to recover from_


### some recommendations re: timing  {.smaller}


* in timing assignment, you'll need to run `fork()` multiple times to measure it
<hr class="vspace" />
* I recommend:
  * always `waitpid` _successfully_ before `fork()`ing a second time
  * test `fork()`ing exactly once before doing a loop
