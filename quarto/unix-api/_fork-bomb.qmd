### warning re: forking in loops  {.smaller}

<!-- \lstset{language=C,style=smaller} -->
 
```
while (true) {
    fork();
}

```
 

* what's going to happen? 

   * lots of CPU being used
   * lots of memory being allocated
   * control-C might only terminate one of the processes

* <em>probably very bad and hard to recover from</em>


### some recommendations re: timing  {.smaller}


* in timing assignment, you'll need to run <code>fork()</code> multiple times to measure it 
<hr class="vspace" />
* I recommend:
* always waitpid <em>successfully</em> before fork()ing a second time
* test fork()ing exactly once before doing a loop
