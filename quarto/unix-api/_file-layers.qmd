### why the extra layer  {.smaller}


* better (but more complex to implement) interface: 

   * read line
   * formatted input (scanf, cin into integer, etc.)
   * formatted output

* less system calls (bigger reads/writes) sometimes faster 

   * buffering can combine multiple in/out library calls into one system call

* more portable interface 

   * cin, printf, etc. defined by C and C++ standards
