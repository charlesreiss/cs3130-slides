### read'ing a fixed amount  {.smaller}


```
ssize_t offset = 0;
const ssize_t amount_to_read = 1024;
char result[amount_to_read];
do {
    /* cast to void * optional in C */
    ssize_t amount_read = 
        read(STDIN_FILENO,
             (void *) (result + offset),
             amount_to_read - offset);
    if (amount_read < 0) {
        perror("read"); /* print error message */
        ... /* abort??? */
    } else {
        offset += amount_read;
    }
} while (offset != amount_to_read && amount_read != 0);

### partial reads  {.smaller}


* on regular file: read reads what you request
* but otherwise: usually gives you what's known to be available 

   * after waiting for something to be available
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* reading from network --- what's been received
* reading from keyboard --- what's been typed
