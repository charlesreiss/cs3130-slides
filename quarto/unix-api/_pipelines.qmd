### pipelines  {.smaller}


* `./program1 | ./program2` 

   * program2's input is program1's output

* example: `ls -1 | grep foo` 

   * `ls -1`: list files (one per line)
   * `grep foo`: output all lines that contain ‘‘foo’’
   * `ls -l | grep foo` list all files whose names contain ‘‘foo’’

* similar to `ls -1 >temp1.txt` then ` grep foo <temp1.txt` 

   * but: no waiting



### pipes 


* in `ls -1 | grep foo`, what is `ls -1`'s output
* trick: in POSIX, there are many types of files 

   * special <i>kind of file</i> called a <em>pipe</em>
