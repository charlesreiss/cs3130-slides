### pipe: closing?  {.smaller}


* if all write ends of pipe are closed 

   * can get end-of-file (read() returning 0) on read end
   * exit()ing closes them

* $\\rightarrow{}$ close write end when not using 
<hr class="vspace" />
* generally: limited number of file descriptors per process
* $\\rightarrow{}$ good habit to close file descriptors not being used
* (but probably didn't matter for read end of pipes in example)
