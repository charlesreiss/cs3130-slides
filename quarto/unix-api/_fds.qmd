### file descriptors  {.smaller}


```
struct process_info {  /* <-- in the kernel somewhere */
    ...
    struct open_file_description *files[SIZE];
    ...
};
...
process->files[file_descriptor]

```
 

* Unix: every process has <br> array (or similar) of <i>open file descriptions</i>
* ‘‘open file’’: [ terminal $\\cdot{}$ socket $\\cdot{}$ regular file $\\cdot{}$ pipe]{.my-small}
* file descriptor = index into array 

   * usually what's used with system calls
   * stdio.h FILE*s usually have file descriptor + buffer
