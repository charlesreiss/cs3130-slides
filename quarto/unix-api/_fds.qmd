### file descriptors  {.smaller}

```c
struct process_info {  /* <-- in the kernel somewhere */
    ...
    struct open_file_description *files[SIZE];
    ...
};
...
process->files[file_descriptor]
```

* Unix: every process has an array (or similar) of _open file descriptions_
* "open file": terminal,  socket, regular file, pipe
* file descriptor = index into array 
   * usually what's used with system calls
   * stdio.h FILE*s usually have file descriptor + buffer
