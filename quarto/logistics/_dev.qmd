### development enviroment 


* we will test via something like SSH into portal  

   * officially supported environment
 

* no restrictions re: IDEs  

   * but make sure you test/know how to run from command line

* many students had success with VSCode + its SSH support


### some notes on VSCode  {.smaller}


* I don't use VSCode (I use vim via SSH+tmux…)
* but many of our TAs do; their advice:… 

* use SSH support to run on portal (dept machine) 

   * tutorial in prior CSO1 lab (linked off course website)

* install Microsoft's C/C++ extension 

   * set C standard in settings as ‘gnu17’ or similar

* install Microsoft's Makefile Tools extension
