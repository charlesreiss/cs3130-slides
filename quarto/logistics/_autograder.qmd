### homework/lab automatic testing  {.smaller}


* some homeworks/labs have automatic testing
* with some delay after you submit 

   * usually 10s of minutes
   * depending on assignment, number of submissions in queue
   * if you submit very early, testing program might not be setup yet

* when testing program doesn't understand/can't test something, <br> left for manual grading (‘‘not yet graded’’)
* intention is that testing results are not surprises <br> if you did some manual testing (no hidden requirements, etc.)
* if you think testing program made a mistake, <br> please submit regrade request
