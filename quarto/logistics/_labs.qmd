### labs  {.smaller}


* attend lab in person and get checked off by TA, <it>or</it>
* (most labs) submit something to submission site and we'll grade it 

   * submit to submission site? don't care if you attend the lab
   * more strict about submissions without checkoffs
   * in-person lab checkoff of incomplete lab at least 50% credit

* some labs will require attendance 

   * or contact me for other arrangements if you can't (sick, etc.)
   * logistically won't work otherwise --- e.g. code review

* if can't make lab in-person (example: sick) 

   * let me know, can arrange late/alternate checkoff



### lab collaboration and submissions

* when working with others on lab and submitting code files

   * via comment or similar
