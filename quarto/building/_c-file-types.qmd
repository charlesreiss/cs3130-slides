Dependency diagram (repeated with slight variations on several slides) showing source files main.c, main.h, extra.h, stdio.h, extra.c; main.s built from main.c, main.h, extra.h, stdio.h; extra.s built from extra.c, extra.h; main.o built from main.s; extra.o built from extra.s; 
and program (an executable) built from main.o, extra.o and system files. The program is shown to load libc.so at runtime.
The first version of the diagram omits the .s files and then shows the .o files produced from the .c and .h files with commands like "clang -c main.c". Then, the .S files are added
with commands like "clang -S -c main.c" that produces them shown. A later slide also show the command "clang -o program main.o extra.o" (used to produce the program from the .o files and some system files).
