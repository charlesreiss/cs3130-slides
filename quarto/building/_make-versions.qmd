### aside: make versions 


* multiple implementations of <code>make</code>
* for stuff we've talked about so far, no differences 

* most common on Linux: GNU make
* will talk about ‘pattern rules', which aren’t supported by some other make versions  

   * older, portable, (in my opinion less intuitive) alternative: suffix rules
