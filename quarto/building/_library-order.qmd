### libraries and command line 


* when linking against libraries use: <br> <code>clang -o executable foo.o bar.o -lName</code> <br> rather than <br> ~~<code>clang -o executable -lName foo.o bar.o</code>~~ <br>
* by default, linker processes files in order
* might only grab things that previous files needed from library 

   * (especially for static libraries)
