### spinlock problems  {.smaller}


* [lock abstraction is not powerful enough]{.fragment fragment-index=4 .custom .myem-only} 

   * lock/unlock operations don't handle ‘‘wait for event’’
   * common thing we want to do with threads
   * solution: other synchronization abstractions

* [spinlocks waste CPU time more than needed]{.fragment fragment-index=3 .custom .myem-only} 

   * want to run another thread instead of infinite loop
   * solution: lock implementation integrated with scheduler

* [spinlocks can send a lot of messages on the shared bus]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only}  

   * more efficient atomic operations to implement locks
