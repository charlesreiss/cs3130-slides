### problem: busy waits 


<pre><code>  <span data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment custom myem-only">while(xchg(&amp;lk-&gt;locked, 1) != 0)</span>
    ; 
</code></pre>
 

* what if it's going to be a while?
* waiting for process that's waiting for I/O?
* really would like to do something else with CPU instead…
