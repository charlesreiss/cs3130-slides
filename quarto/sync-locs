### atomic operation  {.smaller}


* <i>atomic operation</i> = operation that runs to completion or not at all
* we will use these to let threads work together 
<hr class="vspace" />
* most machines: loading/storing [ (aligned)]{.my-small} words is atomic 

   * so can't get $3$ from $x \leftarrow 1$ and $x \leftarrow 2$ running in parallel
   * aligned $\approx$ address of word is multiple of word size (typically done by compilers)

* but some instructions are not atomic; examples: 

   * x86: integer <code>add</code> constant to memory location
   * many CPUs: loading/storing values that cross cache blocks 

      * e.g. if cache blocks <code>0x40</code> bytes, load/store 4 byte from addr. <code>0x3E</code> is not atomic
