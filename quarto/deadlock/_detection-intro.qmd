### deadlock detection 


* why? debugging or fix deadlock by aborting operations
* idea: search for cyclic dependencies


### detecting deadlocks on locks  {.smaller}



* let's say I want to detect deadlocks that only involve mutexes 

   * goal: help programmers debug deadlocks

* … by modifying my threading library:
 
```
struct Thread {
    ... /* stuff for implementing thread */
    /* what extra fields go here? */


};

struct Mutex {
    ... /* stuff for implementing mutex */
    /* what extra fields go here? */


};

```


### deadlock detection  {.smaller}


* why? debugging or fix deadlock by aborting operations
* idea: search for cyclic dependencies
* need: 

   * list of all contended resources
   * what thread is waiting for what?
   * what thread ‘owns’ what?
