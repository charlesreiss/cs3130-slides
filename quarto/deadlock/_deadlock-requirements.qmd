### deadlock requirements  {.smaller}


* <em>mutual exclusion</em> 

   * one thread at a time can use a resource

* <em>hold and wait</em> 

   * thread holding a resources waits to acquire <i>another</i> resource

* <em>no preemption of resources</em> 

   * resources are only released voluntarily
   * thread trying to acquire resources can't ‘steal’

* <em>circular wait</em>  

   * there exists a set $\{T_1,\ldots,T_n\}$ of waiting threads such that 

      * $T_1$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_2$
      * $T_2$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_3$
      * …
      * $T_n$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_1$
