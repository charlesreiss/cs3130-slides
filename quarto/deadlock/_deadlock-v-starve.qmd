### deadlock versus starvation  {.smaller}


* starvation: one+ unlucky (no progress),  one+ lucky (yes progress) 

   * example: low priority threads versus high-priority threads

* deadlock: no one involved in deadlock makes progress

* starvation: once starvation happens, taking turns will resolve 

   * low priority thread just needed a chance…

* deadlock: once it happens, taking turns won't fix
