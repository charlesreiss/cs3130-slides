### aside: deadlock detection in reality  {.smaller}


* requires: 

   * instrumenting contended resources
   * ‘‘undo’’ to get out of deadlock
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* common example: for locks in a database 

   * database typically has customized locking code
   * ‘‘undo’’ exists as side-effect of code for handling power/disk failures

* related idea: <i>avoid</i> deadlock with detection on ‘‘what if’’  scenario 

   * see Banker's algorithm
