### Linux out-of-memory killer  {.smaller}


* Linux by default <i>overcommits</i> memory 

   * tell processes they have <em>more memory than is available</em>
   * (some recommend disabling this feature)

* problem: what if wrong? 

   * could wait for program to finish, free memory…
   * but could be waiting forever because of deadlock

* solution: kill a process 

   * (and try to choose one that's not important)



### database transactions  {.smaller}


* databases operations organized into <i><em>transactions</em></i> 

   * happens <em>all at once or not at all</em>

* until transaction is <i>committed</i>, not finalized
* code to <em>undo</em> transaction in case it's not okay 
<hr class="vspace" />
* database deadlock solution: invoke undo transaction code
* … then rerun transaction later
