### allocating all at once?  {.smaller}


* for resources like disk space, memory 
<hr class="vspace" />
* figure out maximum allocation <em>when starting thread</em> 

   * ‘‘only’’ need conservative estimate

* only start thread if those resources are available 
<hr class="vspace" />
* okay solution for embedded systems?
