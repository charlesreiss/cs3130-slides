### set-user ID gates  {.smaller}


* set-user ID program: gate to higher privilege 

* controlled access to extra functionality
* make authorization/authentication decisions <it>outside the kernel</it>
* way to allow normal users to do <it>one thing that needs privileges</it> 

   * write program that does that one thing --- nothing else!
   * make it owned by user that can do it (e.g. root)
   * mark it set-user-ID

* want to allow only some user to do the thing 

   * make program check which user ran it



### set-user-ID program v syscalls  {.smaller}


* hardware decision: some things only for kernel
* system calls: <it>controlled</it> access to things kernel can do
* decision about how can do it: in the kernel 

* kernel decision: some things only for root (or other user)
* set-user-ID programs: controlled access to things root/… can do
* decision about how can do it: made by root/…
