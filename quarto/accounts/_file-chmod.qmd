### POSIX file permissions  {.smaller}


* POSIX files support a _per-file_ access control list

   * interface is very narrow/limited
   * binary permissions are: **read**, **write**, **execute**
   * set for three categories: **user**, **group**, **other**

* one user ID + read/write/execute bits for user 

   * ‘‘owner’’ --- also can change permissions

* one group ID + read/write/execute bits for group
* default setting --- read/write/execute 

* on directories, "execute" means "search" instead


### permissions encoding  {.smaller}


* permissions encoded as 9-bit number, can write as octal: <code>XYZ</code>
* octal divides into three 3-bit parts: 

   * user permissions (X), group permissions (Y), other permission (Z)

* each 3-bit part has a bit for ‘read’ (4), ‘write’ (2), ‘execute’ (1) 

   * binary number: <code>0bRWE</code>
 

::: {.incremental}
* <code>700</code> --- user read+write+execute; group none; other none
* <code>451</code>?
* <code>451</code> --- user read; group read+execute; other execute
:::


### chmod --- exact permissions  {.smaller}


```
chmod 700 file
chmod u=rwx,go= file
```
 user read write execute; group/others no accesss 
 <hr />
 
```
chmod 451 file
chmod u=r,g=rx,o=x file
```
 user read; group read/execute; others execute

### chmod --- adjusting permissions 


```
chmod u+rx foo
```
 add user read and execute permissions <br> leave other settings unchanged 
 <hr />
 
```
chmod o-rwx,u=rx foo
```
 remove other read/write/execute permissions <br> set user permissions to read/execute <br> leave group settings unchanged
