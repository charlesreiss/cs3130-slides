* more flexible access control lists 

* **list** of (user or group, read or write or execute or …)

* supported by NTFS (Windows)
* a version standardized by POSIX, but usually not supported


### POSIX ACL syntax  {.smaller}


```
# group students have read+execute permissions
group:students:r-x
# group faculty has read/write/execute permissions
group:faculty:rwx
# user mst3k has read/write/execute permissions
user:mst3k:rwx
# user tj1a has no permissions
user:tj1a:---

# POSIX acl rule:
    # user take precedence over group entries
```
