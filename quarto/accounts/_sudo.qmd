* sudo: run command with superuser permissions 

   * started by non-superuser

* recall: inherits non-superuser UID
* can't just call <code>setuid(0)</code>


### set-user-ID sudo  {.smaller}


* extra metadata bit on <it>executables</it>: set-user-ID
* if set: <code>exec()</code> syscall changes effective user ID to owner's ID 

   * ‘‘extra’’ user IDs track what original user was

* <code>sudo</code> program: owned by root, marked set-user-ID 

   * sudo's code: if (original user allowed) ...; else print error
 

* marking setuid: <code>chmod u+s</code>
