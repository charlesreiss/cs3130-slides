### opening a file?

- say, private file on portal

- for example:

```c
open("/u/bradjc/private.txt", O_RDONLY)
```

- on Linux: makes <it>system call</it>
- kernel needs to decide if this should work or not

### deciding whether syscall should proceed?  {.smaller}


```c
open("/u/bradjc/private.txt", O_RDONLY)
```

* argument: needs extra metadata 

* what would be wrong with using:
  * system call arguments?
  * where the code calling open came from?
