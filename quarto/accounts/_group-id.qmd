### POSIX groups  {.smaller}


```c
// process's "effective" group ID
gid_t getegid(void);

// process's extra group IDs
int getgroups(int size, gid_t list[]);
```
 

* POSIX also has _group IDs_
* like user IDs: kernel (= core part of OS) only knows numbers 

   * standard library+databases for mapping to names

* [also process has some other group IDs --- we'll talk later]{.my-small}


### id command  {.smaller}


```
: /u/bjc8c ; id
uid=858545(bjc8c) gid=90002(csfaculty)
groups=90002(csfaculty),150015(slurm-cs-brad-campbell)
```
 
 

* id command displays uid, gid, group list
* names looked up in database 

   * kernel doesn't know about this database
   * code in the C standard library



### groups that don't correspond to users 


* example: video group for access to monitor 

* put process in video group when logged in directly
* don't do it when SSH'd in 

<!-- * … but: user can keep program running with video group <br> in the background after logout? -->
