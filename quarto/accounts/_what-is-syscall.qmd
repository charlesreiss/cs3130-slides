### system call = ???  {.smaller}


* (more detail in later lecture)
* way for programs to make request to OS:
* program sets registers to indicate requested operation  

   * example: ‘‘open foo.txt’’
   * ‘‘system call number’’ (open) and ‘‘arguments’’ (foo.txt)

* program runs special instruction (x86-64: <code>syscall</code>)
* hardware switches into <it>privileged</it> mode + runs OS function
* OS function decodes requested operation from registers
* OS function <it>decides</it> if operation is allowed to proceed
