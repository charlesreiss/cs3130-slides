### system call = ???  {.smaller}


* (more detail in later lecture)
* way for programs to make request to OS:

   1. program sets registers to indicate requested operation

      * example: ‘‘open foo.txt’’
        * register 1: ‘‘system call number’’ (eg, open)
        * register 2: ‘‘arguments’’ (eg, foo.txt)

   2. program runs special instruction (x86-64: `syscall`)
   3. hardware switches into _privileged_ mode + runs OS function
   4. OS function decodes requested operation from registers
   5. OS function _decides_ if operation is allowed to proceed
