### user IDs  {.smaller}


* most common way OSes identify ‘‘who’’ process belongs to:  

   * process = instance of running program (w/ own registers+memory)
   * (we'll be more specific about processes later)
 

* (unspecified for now) procedure sets user IDs
* every process has a user ID
* user ID used to decide what process is authorized to do


### POSIX user IDs  {.smaller}


```
uid_t geteuid(); // get current process's "effective" user ID
```
 

* process's user identified with unique number
* core part of OS only knows number (not name!) 

   * core, always loaded part of OS = ‘‘kernel’’
   * the part of the OS with extra privs with hardware
   * the part of the OS that enforces program restrictions

* effective user ID is used for all permission checks
* also some other user IDs
* standard programs/library maintain number to name mapping 

   * <code>/etc/passwd</code> on typical single-user systems
   * network database on department machines
