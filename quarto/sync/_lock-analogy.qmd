* agreement: only change account balances while wearing this hat
* normally hat kept on table
* put on hat when editing balance 
<hr class="vspace" />
* hopefully, only one person (= thread) can wear hat a time
* need to wait for them to remove hat to put it on 
<hr class="vspace" />
* ‘‘lock (or acquire) the lock’’ = get and put on hat
* ‘‘unlock (or release) the lock’’ = put hat back on table
