### transaction implementation ideas  {.smaller}


* [(for consistency)]{.my-small}
* simple idea: do one transaction at a time
* more efficient(?) idea:  

   * get list of operations
   * lock everything operations use (in consistent order to prevent deadlock)
   * do operations on list
   * unlock everything

* (also other strategies with different flexibility/efficiency)
