### semaphore intuition  {.smaller}


* What do you need to wait for? 

   * critical section to be finished
   * queue to be non-empty
   * array to have space for new items

* what can you count that will be 0 when you need to wait? 

   * # of threads that can start critical section now
   * # of threads that can join another thread without waiting
   * # of items in queue
   * # of empty spaces in array

* use up/down operations to maintain count
