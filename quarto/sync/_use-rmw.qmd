### using atomic exchange?  {.smaller}



* example: OS wants something done by whichever core tries first
* does not want it started twice!
* if two cores try at once, only one should do it
 
```
int global_flag = 0;
void DoThingIfFirstToTry() {
    int my_value = 1;
    AtomicExchange(&my_value, &global_flag);
    if (my_value == 0) {
        /* flag was zero before, so I was first!*/
        DoThing();
    } else {
        /* flag was already 1 when we exchanged */
        /* I was second, so some other core is handling it */
    }
}

```
