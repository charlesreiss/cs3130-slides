### connecting CPUs and memory 


* multiple processors, common memory
* how do processors communicate with memory?


### shared bus  {.smaller}

* one possible design 

   * we'll revisit later when we talk about I/O

* <em>tagged</em> messages --- everyone gets everything, filters
* contention if multiple communicators 

   * some hardware enforces only one at a time



### shared buses and scaling 


* shared buses perform poorly with ‘‘too many’’ CPUs
* so, there are other designs 
<hr class="vspace" />
* we'll gloss over these for now


### shared buses and caches  {.smaller}


* remember caches?
* memory is <em>pretty slow</em>
* each CPU wants to keep local copies of memory 
<hr class="vspace" />
* what happens when multiple CPUs cache same memory?
