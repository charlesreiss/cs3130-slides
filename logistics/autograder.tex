\begin{frame}{homework/lab automatic testing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some homeworks/labs have automatic testing
    \item with some delay after you submit
        \begin{itemize}
        \item usually 10s of minutes
        \item depending on assignment, number of submissions in queue
        \item if you submit very early, testing program might not be setup yet
        \end{itemize}
    \item when testing program doesn't understand/can't test something, \\
        left for manual grading (``not yet graded'')
    \item intention is that testing results are not surprises \\
        if you did some manual testing (no hidden requirements, etc.)
    \item if you think testing program made a mistake, \\
        please submit regrade request
    \end{itemize}
