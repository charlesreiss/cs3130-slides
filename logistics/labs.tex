\begin{frame}{labs}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item attend lab in person and get checked off by TA, \textit{or}
    \item (most labs) submit something to submission site and we'll grade it
        \begin{itemize}
        \item submit to submission site? don't care if you attend the lab
        \item more strict about submissions without checkoffs being complete/correct \\
            (can't tell how much time you actually spent)
        \item in-person lab checkoff of incomplete lab at least 50\% credit
        \end{itemize}
    \item some labs will basically require attendance
        \begin{itemize}
        \item or contact me for other arrangements if you can't (sick, etc.)
        \item logistically won't work otherwise --- e.g. code review
        \end{itemize}
