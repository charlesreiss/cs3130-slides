\begin{frame}{waitlists}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 2p, 3:30p heavily limited by room capacity!
    \item if you are on waitlist, suggest changing to 5p/6:30p
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item if on 5pm waitlist, probably something keeping you from registering
        \begin{itemize}
        \item e.g. credit hour limit, time conflict
        \end{itemize}
