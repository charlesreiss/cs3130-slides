\begin{frame}{two sections}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item shared assignments, labs, TAs
        \item generally, one of Prof Campbell/Reiss will lead lecture for each day (both sections)
        \item subject to space constraints, I don't care if you attend `wrong' lecture
            \begin{itemize}
            \item exception: midterms (clear with us)
            \end{itemize}
