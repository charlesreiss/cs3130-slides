\begin{frame}[fragile]{UDP v TCP}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item TCP: stream to other program
        \begin{itemize}
        \item need to connect to specific server
        \item ``connecting'' fails if server not responding
        \item (at least) one socket per remote program being talked to
        \end{itemize}
    \item UDP: messages sent to program, but no reliablity/streams
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{SOCK\_DGRAM} with socket() instead of \texttt{SOCK\_STREAM}
        \item can sendto()/recvfrom() multiple other programs with one socket
            \begin{itemize}
                \item (but don't have to)
            \end{itemize}
        \item send messages which are limited in size, unreliable
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
