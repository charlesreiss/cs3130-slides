\begin{frame}[fragile]{UDP v TCP}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item UDP: messages sent to program, but no reliablity/streams
        \begin{itemize}
        \item get assigned port number
        \item \texttt{SOCK\_DGRAM} with socket() instead of \texttt{SOCK\_STREAM}
        \item can sendto()/recvfrom() multiple other programs with one socket
            \begin{itemize}
            \item (but don't have to)
            \end{itemize}
        \item send messages which are limited in size, unreliable
        \end{itemize}
    \item TCP: stream to other program
        \begin{itemize}
        \item need to bind() + listen() + accept() or connect() to setup connection
        \item one socket per connection
        \item read/write bytes --- divided into messages automatically
        \item reliable --- acknowledgments/resending handled for you
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
