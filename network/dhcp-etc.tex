\begin{itemize}
\item problem: how does my machine get IP address
\vspace{.5cm}
\item otherwise:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item have sysadmin type one in?
    \item just choose one?
    \item \myemph<2>{ask machine on local network to assign it}
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<3-> often local router machine runs service to assign IP addresses
    \begin{itemize}
    \item knows what IP addresses are available
    \item sysadmin might configure in mapping from MAC addresses to IP addresses
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DHCP high-level}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item protocol done over UDP
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item but since we don't have IP address yet, use \texttt{0.0.0.0}
    \item and since we don't know server address, use \texttt{255.255.255.255}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item = ``everyone on the local network''
        \end{itemize}
    \item local server replies to request with address + \myemph<2>{time limit}
    \item later: can send messages to local server to renew/give up address
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{exercise: why time limit?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DHCP ``lease''
        \item rather than getting address forever
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item but DHCP has way of releasing taken address
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item why impose a time limit
    \end{itemize}
