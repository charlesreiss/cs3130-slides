    \begin{itemize}
    \item Ethernet + Wifi have checksums
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item Q1: Why doesn't this give us uncorrupted messages?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Why do we still have checksums at the higher layers?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Q2: What's a benefit of doing this if we're also doing it in the higher layer?
    \end{itemize}
