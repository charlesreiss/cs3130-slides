    \item ``private'' IP addresses
    \item not used on the Internet
    \item commonly connected to Internet with \myemph{network address translation}
    \item also 100.64.0.0--100.127.255.255 (but with restrictions)

\begin{frame}{network address translation}
\begin{itemize}
\item IPv4 addresses are kinda scarce
\item solution: \textit{convert} many private addrs. to one public addr.
\item locally: use private IP addresses for machines
\item outside: private IP addresses become a single public one
\item commonly how home networks work (and some ISPs)
\end{itemize}
