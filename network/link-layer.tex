\begin{frame}{the link layer}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DOCSIS (cable modems), \ldots
\vspace{.5cm}
\item allows send/recv messages to machines on ``same'' network segment
    \begin{itemize}
    \item typically: wireless range+channel or connected to a single switch/router
    \item could be larger (if \textit{bridging} multiple network segments)
    \item could be smaller (switch/router uses ``virtual LANs'')
    \end{itemize}
\item typically: source+destination specified with MAC addresses
    \begin{itemize}
    \item MAC = media access control
    \item usually manufacturer assigned / hard-coded into device
    \item unique address per port/wifi transmitter/etc.
    \end{itemize}
\item can specify destination of ``anyone'' (called \textit{broadcast})
\end{itemize}
