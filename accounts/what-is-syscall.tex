\begin{frame}{What is a system call?}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item (Will discuss in more detail in next lecture)
	\item Briefly - syscall {\em instruction} takes system call number as argument
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Other arguments are placed in registers or on the stack
		\end{itemize}
	\item This instruction switches hardware into privileged mode and uses syscall number to find correct handler function
	\item This function decides if the "open" call is allowed to proceed
	\item Only implemented syscalls are supported - can't invoke fake syscall
	\item Handlers written carefully (we hope) to ensure safe implementation and correct permission checking
	\end{itemize}
