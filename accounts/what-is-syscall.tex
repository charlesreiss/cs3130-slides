\begin{frame}{What is a system call?}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item (will discuss in more detail in next lecture)
	\item Briefly - special syscall {\em instruction} run w/ \textit{system call number} set
            \begin{itemize}
            \item system call number = open requested
            \item other arguments passed like a normal function
            \end{itemize}
	\item instruction switches hardware into privileged mode, runs OS function
	\item this function decides if the ``open'' call is allowed to proceed
	\item only implemented syscalls are supported
	\item handlers written carefully (we hope) to ensure correct permission checking
	\end{itemize}
