\begin{itemize}
\item set-user ID program: gate to higher privilege
\vspace{.5cm}
\item controlled access to extra functionality
\item make authorization/authentication decisions \textit{outside the kernel}
\item way to allow normal users to do \textit{one thing that needs privileges}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item write program that does that one thing --- nothing else!
    \item make it owned by user that can do it (e.g. root)
    \item mark it set-user-ID
    \end{itemize}
\item want to allow only some user to do the thing
    \begin{itemize}
    \item make program check which user ran it
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{set-user-ID program v syscalls}
\begin{itemize}
\item hardware decision: some things only for kernel
\item system calls: \textit{controlled} access to things kernel can do
\item decision about how can do it: in the kernel
\vspace{.5cm}
\item kernel decision: some things only for root (or other user)
\item set-user-ID programs: controlled access to things root/\ldots{} can do
\item decision about how can do it: made by root/\ldots
