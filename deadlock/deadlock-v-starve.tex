\begin{frame}{deadlock versus starvation}
\begin{itemize}
\item starvation: one+ unlucky (no progress), 
                  one+ lucky (yes progress)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item example: low priority threads versus high-priority threads
    \end{itemize}
\item deadlock: no one involved in deadlock makes progress
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<2-> starvation: once starvation happens, taking turns will resolve
    \begin{itemize}
    \item low priority thread just needed a chance\ldots
    \end{itemize}
\item<2-> deadlock: once it happens, taking turns won't fix
\end{itemize}
