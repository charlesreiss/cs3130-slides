\begin{frame}{Linux out-of-memory killer}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux by default \textit{overcommits} memory
    \begin{itemize}
    \item tell processes they have \myemph{more memory than is available}
    \item (some recommend disabling this feature)
    \end{itemize}
\item problem: what if wrong?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item could wait for program to finish, free memory\ldots
    \item but could be waiting forever because of deadlock
    \end{itemize}
\item solution: kill a process
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (and try to choose one that's not important)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{database transactions}
\begin{itemize}
\item databases operations organized into \textit{\myemph{transactions}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item happens \myemph{all at once or not at all}
    \end{itemize}
\item until transaction is \textit{committed}, not finalized
\item code to \myemph{undo} transaction in case it's not okay
\vspace{.5cm}
\item database deadlock solution: invoke undo transaction code
\item \ldots then rerun transaction later
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
