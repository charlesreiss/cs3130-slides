\begin{frame}{using deadlock detection for prevention}
\begin{itemize}
\item suppose you know the \textit{maximum resources} a process could request
\item make decision \myemph{when starting process} (``\textit{admission control}'')
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<2-> ask ``what if every process was waiting for maximum resources''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item including the one we're starting
    \end{itemize}
\item<2-> would it cause deadlock? then \myemph{don't let it start}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<2-> called Baker's algorithm
