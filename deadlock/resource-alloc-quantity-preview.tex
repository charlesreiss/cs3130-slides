\begin{frame}{resource allocation graphs and quantity}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item so far: assuming resource is fully taken or not at all taken
    \item what about resources like memory?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item two processes can take parts of resource
        \item \ldots but deadlock still possible
        \end{itemize}
    \item there's a version of resource allocation graphs for this case
    \end{itemize}
