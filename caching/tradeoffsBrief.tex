\begin{frame}{cache tradeoffs briefly}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item deciding cache size, associativity, etc.?
    \item lots of tradeoffs:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item more cache hits v. slower cache hits?
        \item faster cache hits v. fewer cache hits?
        \item more cache hits v. slower cache misses?
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \item details depend on programs run
        \begin{itemize}
        \item how often is same block used again?
        \item how often is same index bits used?
        \end{itemize}
    \item simulation to assess impact of designs
    \end{itemize}
