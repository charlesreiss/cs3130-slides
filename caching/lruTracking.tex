    \begin{itemize}
    \item need to track total order
    \item worst case: bunch of new accesses to same set
        \begin{itemize}
        \item first replaces least recently used
        \item next replaces next least recently used
        \item etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item hard to track, so frequently only approximated
    \end{itemize}
