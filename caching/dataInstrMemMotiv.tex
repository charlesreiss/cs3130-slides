\begin{frame}{recall: data/instruction memory}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item model in CPU: one cycle per access
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item but earlier --- had to talk to memory on different chip
    \item can't do that in one cycle
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item solution: keep copies of part of memory (``cache'')
        \begin{itemize}
        \item copy can be accessed quickly
        \item hope: almost always use copy?
        \end{itemize}
