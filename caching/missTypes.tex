\begin{frame}{cache miss types}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item common to categorize misses:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item roughly ``cause'' of miss assuming cache block size fixed
            \end{itemize}
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item \textit{compulsory} (or \textit{cold}) --- \myemph{first time} accessing something
            \begin{itemize}
            \item adding more sets or blocks/set wouldn't change
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textit{conflict} --- sets aren't big/flexible enough
            \begin{itemize}
            \item a fully-associtive (1-set) cache of the same size would have done better
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textit{capacity} --- cache was not big enough
    \end{itemize}
